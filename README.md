# Circuit Python experiments

## Description

I ordered some Xiao RP2040s a while back, intending to create a blinking device that would allow me to identify a server pretty quickly from a bunch of identical boxes. This is my experiments with the device and piecing together tutorials so I can send input to the xiao and then make it change the RGB LED on demand. It's more for fun, but it could be useful if you have a large number of identical boxes and you're not sure which one is which when they are racked up.

It was also pretty easy to come up with a primitive mouse jiggler using only a few lines of circuit python. The Circuit python libraries are definitely very powerful.
